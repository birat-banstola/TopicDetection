# TopicDetection

This system would help to identify a hot topic or a trending topic in news media 
like twitter.



Considering the massive amounts of Twitter users and the 
impressive number of tweets generated we monitor a random sample 
among all public messages. As an example, one of the most prominent 
topics was the airstrike on Syria (Syrian airstrike). It was a “hot” topic for 
almost 5 days. It was emerging topic on 14th April 2018 and was a “hot” topic 
till 18th April 2018. 
“Syria” was a keyword which had maximum Term Frequency in 
most cases, followed by “airstrike”. As it was a recent event its popularity 
was high even when the application was run multiple times. Prominent 
figures tweeting about it made sure it had a high User Authority. Since it 
was a trending topic for 5 days, its Content Ageing was above the 
threshold value. Supervised technique was then used to check it was 
above the user mentioned threshold value. This allowed us to conclude 
that “Syrian airstrike” was a keyword.
